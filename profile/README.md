### Who Are We?

HackEA is the first ever hackathon for High schoolers in East Africa, created by high schoolers with the goal of empowering our local communities using tech. Our vision is to see us as high schoolers contributing to a greater cause of introducing and empowering more students to pursue working with technology in Africa as a whole

### 🌈 What is A Hackathon and Why Are We Organising One?

How often do teenagers from different countries, schools or cultures come together to build, share and learn? Hackathons often are reserved for university students leaving high schoolers passionate in tech without opportunities to build their skills and have their skills seen. HackEA aims to give high school students from across the East African Community the platform to do just that.

### Audience

We aim for the event to bring together 150-200 participants, including:

High school students from across the East African Community.
Teachers and mentors passionate about technology and education.
Tech professionals, entrepreneurs, and experts from various industries.
Participants will be primarily students with a keen interest in tech but varying experience, eager to explore both hardware and software development.

The panel will comprise of 10 judges,  10 mentors and 6 workshop speakers.
